        <p>Sebastien has spent the last 6 years as Brewer in the Canadian Rockies,
            notably at Mt. Begbie Brewing Company and Fernie Brewing Company. Here he learned 
            about the mechanical use and maintenace of brewing equipement and their softwares.
            He also refined his discipline of task allocation, as it was important to line up various
            responsibilities in a timely manner for the next shift worker.

                Sebastien has also worked an extensive array of aggricultural practices.
                He managed brassica farm and avacado orchard in Western Austalia, worked on vineyards
                in New Zealand, worked the cotton fields of the outback and helped with forest conservation
                in Kenya to name a few. Farming thought him the lesson of a hards day work and 
                to never quit on a job that needs doing. He also learned how to manage teams of workers efficiently.
